## üß† Strategy Overview

Core Idea (Power of 3 Strategy)
Asian Session (Accumulation)

Price moves sideways in a range (low volatility).

London Session (Manipulation / Liquidity Grab)

Price takes out liquidity (fakeout above or below Asian range).

New York Session (Distribution / True Move)

Price reverses and shows the real direction of the day.

The Power of 3 (PO3) is based on:

1. **Accumulation (Asian session)**
2. **Manipulation (London session)**
3. **Distribution (New York session)**

The EA detects fakeouts during London and takes directional trades in NY session.

üß† Strategy Rules (Derived from Charts)
For SELL Setup (as shown in your example):
Asian range is formed.

During London, price sweeps the high of the Asian range (enters a key level).

Wait for a rejection or confirmation candle (e.g., bearish engulfing) after the sweep.

Enter SHORT trade.

Target is a measured move down, likely at or beyond Asian low.

For BUY Setup (opposite logic):
Price sweeps Asian low in London session.

New York gives true move upward.
